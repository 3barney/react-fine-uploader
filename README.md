Makes using Fine Uploader in a React app simple. Drop-in high-level components for a turn-key UI. Use small focused components to build a more custom UI.

This is currently an unstable in-progress project. Breaking changes may occur at any time without notice until the version has reached 1.0. See the [wiki for details regarding the design plans](../../wiki).
